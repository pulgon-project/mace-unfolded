# mace-unfolded

Contains calculators for computing the heat flux for MACE. 

The unfolder was originally written for the publication "Marcel F. Langer, Florian Knoop, Christian Carbogno, Matthias Scheffler, and Matthias Rupp
Phys. Rev. B 108, L100302" and adapted for use with MACE.

To install:

pip install .

Requires the comms package from:

https://github.com/sirmarcel/comms

This is purely for logging and debugging. Considering the limited support and functionality, this dependency should be removed in the future.
